# Building a Decision Tree Model to Predict Survival on the Titanic Dataset
This project aims to build a decision tree model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on certain parameters using the Titanic dataset. 
The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers who were on board the Titanic when it sank, including their age, gender, ticket class, fare, 
and whether they survived or not.

The goal of this project is to use the data in the Titanic dataset to build a decision tree model that can accurately predict whether a passenger 
would have survived or not based on their attributes.

# Approach
To build a decision tree model to predict survival based on certain parameters, we will follow these steps:

* Load the Titanic dataset into Python and perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
* Split the dataset into a training set and a testing set.
* Use the training set to build a decision tree model using a Python library like scikit-learn.
* Evaluate the performance of the model using the testing set and metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
* Tune the hyperparameters of the model to improve its performance.

# Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:

* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn

# Usage
To run this project, you can follow these steps:

# Conclusion
Building a decision tree model to predict survival on the Titanic dataset can provide valuable insights into the factors that influenced a 
passenger's chances of survival. By following the steps outlined in this project, you can build an accurate and reliable model that can be used to make 
predictions on new data.
